To run the project you need to do the following:

1. Take the REST client code generated from the REST APIs and drop it under: src/main/java/com/eurotech/could/apis/v2/model
2. Make sure the dependency with the EDC client project is in place or you have the jar files of the edc client and its dependencies in the classpath.
